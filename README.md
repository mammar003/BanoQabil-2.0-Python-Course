# Password Generator

The Password Generator is a Python script that generates a strong password based on user input. The generated password includes a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters to enhance security.

## Problem Statement

## Usage

1. **Input Length:** Run the script and enter the desired length of the password when prompted. The length should be between 8 and 20 characters.

2. **Generate Password:** After entering the password length, the script will generate a strong password consisting of a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.

3. **Output:** The generated password will be displayed on the console.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-generator.git
   
1.Navigate to the project directory:
cd password-generator

2.Run the script:
